# OptimBlog - blog module for Opencart 3
This module allows you to create an infinite number of articles and categories for them. For example, you can create categories «News», «Articles», «Promotions», as well as create a full blog for your store with the breakdown of materials into categories.


## Concept and difference from other blog modules for Opencart 3.
### Other blogs for Opencart 3
Most (may been 100%, I have not seen analogues) of blog modules and other similar use the concept of cloning software code (controllers and related files - Model-View-Controller) categories of products and products themselves, turning scripts:
1. «product category» → «category of articles»
2. «product» → «article»
3. cloning Database tables is similar to categories and products.

Such an approach causes many conflicts. Errors and inconsistencies in practice was more than enough. Describe them all here does not make sense..

### OptimBlog - concept and main idea
1. Categories are assigned a type - Product/Article.
2. The functional of the Article is extended in the same way as the functional of the Product.
3. Reviews similarly categories are divided into 2 types - Product/Article. And also added the ability to display «Store Reply» to «Review» using HTML.
4. This blog module does not replace Opencart 3 files.
5. The concept of Opencart in the names and definitions has been saved, and the appearance of the interface familiar to the store administrator has been saved too.
6. There is no conflict **SEO URL**, because it uses the functionality of Opencart. Which you can expand by the applied modifications.
7. The module consists of 90% modifications files that can be deleted or disabled at any time.
